# Portfolio V 3.0

### VS Code Extension
As I code I prefer to keep the problems tag in the terminal open. I will address the issues as they come up. Many times these warnings are due to my extensions. I find they do more good than bad and so in reviewing my code you may wonder what some of the syntax inside comments are all about. 

I use the `Better Comments` extension to help me better keep track. This ext sets comments to different colors that draw my eye. If you have not used it, I would recommend it. As I go along or as I review, I use this ext to leave comments or explain something I don't want to forget.

I also use a spell checker which is awesome seeing as I am a terrible speller. However, there are some made up words that `cSpell` thinks are spelled wrong, when they are just abbreviations I used for naming. This extension allows to ignore these words by commenting the list out. This is what all the cSpell ignore comments are about.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
