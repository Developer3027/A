          Getting started with a website can seem complicated. Let’s see if we can
          simplify it a bit. The first thing you need is a domain name and
          hosting.
        </LightText>
        <LightText>
          The domain name is the registered name the world can find you at. Nearly
          any hosting service is going to have a way for you to register a domain
          name. A domain name is going to have an extension like .com or .org. You
          should do some research in this regard. There are some 280 different
          domain extensions delegated globally. You may wish to incorporate the
          extension into your name by using .ly or .me like bit.ly did. There are
          extensions with restrictions you may want to take advantage of like .us
          which is only for us citizens, organizations or foreign entities with a
          us presence. There are extensions that are common to television, radio,
          organizations, and networks that help both sell your brand and organize
          the web.
        </LightText>
        <LightText>
          Now that you have the name, it is time to find a home. Your hosting
          provider will give you a place to set up your site and point the domain
          name to it. A good hosting provider will give you a ton of options you
          may not be familiar with. They also explain themselves well and have a
          customer service department.
        </LightText>
        <LightText>
          Some things to consider when looking for hosting. Is there customer
          support? Are subdomains an option? Is there a uptime guarantee? Are
          there options for shared and dedicated server space? Do they use ssd
          drives? In many cases, a “yes” depends on the package you get, and that
          is ok. You want to ensure you can get the service or performance you
          need as you expand and grow.

        <LightText>
          There are several different ways that web site / app developers choose
          to handle dealing with domain registration and hosting. I prefer to
          assist my clients in getting the domain and hosting locked down, then
          receive access from the client. When you get the hosting you will
          receive a email and password. Simply hand that information over to me
          and I will take it from there.
        </LightText>
        <LightText>
          In my opinion the name and hosting should be owned by the client from
          start to finish. This gives the client the control from the start. As a
          designer and a developer, I am not constrained to the name or the host
          and can start work before this process is complete. Whether you want a
          app or site, I have tools that allow me to collaborate with clients
          during design and tech that allows clients to preview the site or app in
          progress.

          I can offer a simple site of just a few pages. I bake SEO meta data into
          every site. All sites today require either social platforms to be set up
          or links to be integrated. You may need to work with a copywriter or
          need design work, both of which I can assist with.

          No matter the project, big or small, my goal is to provide you with an
          excellence of service. From our first meeting I will help guide you
          through this process. From acquiring the domain and hosting to every
          other step along the way. There is no reason for us to split ways once
          the project is complete. In many cases, projects are completed in
          phases, whether they are designed that way or not. That is why I have
          this maintenance package. I am here to help you exceed your goals, guide
          you and teach you. My job is not done once you have your product. You
          will need little tweaks, minor fixes, plugins or tech updated and bugs
          fixed due to those updates or ensure your SSL certificates don’t run
          out. With this package I stay on top of your project and ensure it stays
          fresh, clean and working for you.

        <LightText>
          SEO is important for every site. I am not a SEO professional but I do
          include SEO meta data tags in every site. This meta data performs two
          important tasks. It provides sites and apps the information they need to
          format that nice card preview when linking the site, as well as giving
          search engine bots the information they need to find and list your site.

        <LightText>
          The foundation of the internet, Html. Hypertext Markup Language is used as the base layer to all the pages of the internet, even today. React maybe a javascript framework and powerful but I uses a syntax called jsx which compiles down to good ol Html. If you really do not need a lot of bells and whistles, just want a good looking site that will stand the test of time, look no further. Html and CSS are just what you have been looking for.

        <LightText>
          Javascript is the language of the internet. Chrome is built off of it. It is what gives every page functionality. The sky is the limit with javascript. Manipulate components and items on the page or create new ones when you need to. Any web page you have visited that did a thing, it is more likely that javascript made it do that thing than not.

          ReactJs is a javascript framework built and maintained by facebook. It is designed to create ui elements and it does it wonderfully. This site was built with React. I love how it works and the app's I can make with it. React works on the client side and will only change those things that need changing when a user interacts with a page. It is sleek and powerful and very fast.

        <LightText>
          WordPress is the most common way sites are built today. Elementor is the
          number one plugin for wordpress that easily allows wordpress developers
          to create professional looking and functional sites quickly. Clients
          really like this arrangement for several reasons. Top on that list is
          the easy of switching developers. Having a site built with the most used
          platform and the most common plugin ensures that the client site can be
          worked on by the widest range of developers, now or in the future. It
          allows clients the freedom to organize and build sites in stages as well
          as shop around developers for the best price.

          I use Elementor Pro to build my WordPress sites. The pro version of
          Elementor requires a yearly subscription of $49. I break this into a
          monthly payment of $4.50 that is included in the maintenance and upkeep
          of the site.

          A landing page is a specifically designed advertisement page. It is a
          single, scrolling page made of several sections and a single call to
          action. A typical page would consist of a hero section that includes a
          unique selling proposition or cta, the benefits of your product or
          service, and social proof. You may wish to include a form to collect
          emails.

          A WordPress Blog site is a site where one can write and post different
          articles. WordPress is used as a CMS (content management system). This
          is a 4 page site where the home page is the blog archive page. The
          archive page holds a list of posts to review. Clicking on a post will
          open that post article, allowing you to read the entire article. It can
          be set to allow comments or not. Link your social media to improve SEO
          and be more effective at selling the product or idea. I am happy to set
          up your social media accounts if needed.

          to. Setting up social links will increase both sales and SEO potential.
